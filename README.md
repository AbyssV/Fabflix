### in CalculateAverage.java (the one calculate the time for TJ and TS) 
### I first use a while loop to scan the two values in log file (one TJ and one TS), and the add these two number to sum_TS and sum_TJ, after the while loop, I devide the total by line number in my log file. I also have a variable count total line number.
